CommonEmmiter

In this project I was tasked to write a winforms application to aid in the creation of simple BJT circuits with a chosen common ground and Bias.

Skills demonstated in this project show working with Windows Forms and controls and doing simple mathematics in code. Also very basic file I/O is shown by saving the results of the outputs to a text file for easy look up later.
